# My-Wallpaper
Some wallpapers i found on github, reddit and discord.
Sorry for the mess, I'm to lazy to sort them

To download simply do:
```
git clone https://github.com/Aiclys/wallpapers
```
You can also do `rm -rf ~/wallpapers/README.md` to delete the readme file.

DISCLAIMER: NONE OF THESE WALLPAPERS ARE MY ARTWORK OR MINE IN ANY WAY. USE THEM FREELY AS YOU LIKE
